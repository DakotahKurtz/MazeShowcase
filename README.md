# MazeShowcase
JavaFX program, illustrates and animates various maze generation algorithms.

Breadth-First
Depth-First
Kruskal's Algorithm
Wilson's Algorithm
Prim's Algorithm
Recursive Division

Each time the state of the maze changes, that state is saved. This allows the user to step forward and backwards through the generation process, seeing which
cells are currently being inspected or changed, and what decisions the various algorithms make, and when.
